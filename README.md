NEA Computer Science Project (Dice Game) made with zero external dependencies.

# Help
- The whole menu is command-line based (run 'help' in the menu)
- To make an account/login you must do so after running 'play', login/register prompts will be shown for both users.

**This is now finished as it has been submitted; however there is still tons of polishing (excuse the pun) to do.**

# How to run?
**Make sure you are running python 3.6 or above! The program will refuse to start if the version is not satisfied (mainly for type safety features)**

- Run `python main.py` in the root directory of the program (or `py main.py` if it does not work)
- Alternatively you may also run it with Idle by going to edit `main.py` and pressing `F5`
